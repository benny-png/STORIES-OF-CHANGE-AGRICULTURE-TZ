## Overview

**STORIES-OF-CHANGE-AGRICULTURE-TZ** is a project aimed at visualizing agricultural changes in Tanzania through interactive choropleth maps. The project utilizes GeoJSON data for Tanzanian regions and Plotly for map visualization, providing insights into agricultural data and trends.

This project was created for the Jamii Forums' Challenge "Stories of Change." [Read more about it here](https://www.jamiiforums.com/threads/exponential-development-vision-2035-dira-ya-maendeleo-ya-kasi-2035.2217724/).

## Features

- **GeoJSON Data Integration**: Displays geographical boundaries of Tanzanian regions.
- **Interactive Maps**: Utilizes Plotly to create dynamic and interactive choropleth maps.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes agricultural data, highlighting changes and trends over time.
- **CSV Data Processing**: Reads and processes agricultural data from CSV files.
- **Greedy Algorithm Optimizer**: Implements a greedy algorithm to optimize regional networks based on food production data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- plotly
- geopandas
- json

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/benny-png/STORIES-OF-CHANGE-AGRICULTURE-TZ.git
    cd STORIES-OF-CHANGE-AGRICULTURE-TZ
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas plotly geopandas json
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your data: Ensure `food_production_data.csv` and `TZA_adm1_mkoaTZ.geojson` are correctly formatted and contain the necessary data.

2. Run the script to generate the choropleth map:
    ```bash
    python map_plotter_test.py
    ```

3. Run the optimizer script to visualize optimized regional networks:
    ```bash
    python optimizer_map.py
    ```

4. The map will display the agricultural data across Tanzanian regions grouped in zones, allowing for interactive exploration and clssification of the zones based on data and number of mega-industries.
